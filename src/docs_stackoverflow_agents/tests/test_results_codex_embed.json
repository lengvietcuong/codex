        "base_answer": "Set the 'reasoning_format' parameter to either 'parsed' or 'raw' in the API request.",
        "model_answer": "To see the reasoning content when using Groq's API to access DeepSeek R1, you can utilize the `reasoning_format` parameter in your API request. This parameter allows you to control how the model's reasoning process is presented. Here are the options and how to use them:\n\n### Options for Reasoning Format\n\n- **`parsed`**: Separates reasoning into a dedicated field while keeping the response concise.\n- **`raw`**: Includes reasoning within `think` tags in the content.\n- **`hidden`**: Returns only the final answer for maximum efficiency.\n\n### Example in Python\n\nHere is an example of how to set the `reasoning_format` parameter to `raw` in a Python script:\n\n```python\nfrom groq import Groq\n\nclient = Groq()\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b\",\n    messages=[\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"How many r's are in the word strawberry?\"\n        }\n    ],\n    temperature=0.6,\n    max_completion_tokens=1024,\n    top_p=0.95,\n    stream=True,\n    reasoning_format=\"raw\"\n)\n\nfor chunk in completion:\n    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or \"\", end=\"\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `reasoning_format` is set to `raw`, which includes the reasoning content within `think` tags in the response. You can adjust this parameter to `parsed` or `hidden` depending on your needs.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the **Groq Documentation on Reasoning**.",

        "model_answer": "To list all the currently supported models using Groq's API, you can use the `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models` endpoint. This will return a JSON list of all active models. You can use the model IDs mentioned in the documentation to access the models directly through the GroqCloud Models API endpoint. Here is an example of how to use the endpoint in Python: ```python import requests import os api_key = os.environ.get(\"GROQ_API_KEY\") url = \"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models\" headers = { \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {api_key}\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" } response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) print(response.json()) ``` This will print the list of supported models in JSON format. You can then use the model IDs to access the models through the API. Note: You need to replace `GROQ_API_KEY` with your actual API key. Also, you can use the `get_documentation_rag` function to retrieve relevant documentation chunks based on the query with RAG. And use the `get_page_content` function to retrieve the full content of a specific documentation page. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.",

        "model_answer": "In Fireworks AI, models can be fine-tuned using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and deployed as serverless. LoRA is a technique that allows for efficient fine-tuning of large language models by freezing the pretrained model weights and injecting trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer model, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Key Fine-tuning Parameters: Learning Rate - Defines how much the model’s weights adjust per training step. Higher Learning Rates: Faster training, but with a risk of overfitting. Lower Learning Rates: More stable training, but may require more epochs. Typical Range: 1e-4 (0.0001) to 5e-5 (0.00005). Epochs - Number of times the model sees the full training dataset. Recommended: 1-3 epochs (more than 3 is generally not optimal unless you want your model to have much less hallucinations but also less creativity). More Epochs: Better learning, but higher risk of overfitting. Fewer Epochs: May undertrain the model. Advanced Parameters: LoRA Rank - Controls the number of low-rank factors used for adaptation. Recommended Settings: 16-32. LoRA Alpha - Scaling factor for weight updates. Recommended Settings: Ratio of 1-2 with LoRA Rank. LoRA Dropout - Dropout rate to prevent overfitting. Recommended Settings: 0.1-0.2. Max Sequence Length - Maximum number of tokens processed in one input. Recommended Settings: Adjust based on dataset needs. Warmup Steps - Gradually increases learning rate at the start of training. Recommended Settings: 5-10% of total steps. Scheduler Type - Adjusts learning rate dynamically during training. Recommended Settings: Linear Decay, Cosine Annealing. Seed - Ensures reproducibility of results. Recommended Settings: Fixed number (e.g., 42). Batch Size - Number of samples processed per training step. Recommended Settings: Higher values require more VRAM. Quantization - Reduces precision of model weights for efficiency. Recommended Settings: Q4_K_M for balance between performance & speed. Weight Decay - Penalizes large weight updates to prevent overfitting. Recommended Settings: Start at 0.01, adjust as needed. LoRA Configuration Parameters: r (Rank of decomposition) - Controls the fine-tuning process. Suggested: 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128. Higher: Better accuracy on hard tasks but increases memory and risk of overfitting. Lower: Faster, memory-efficient but may reduce accuracy. lora_alpha (Scaling factor) - Determines the learning strength. Suggested: Equal to or double the rank (r). Higher: Learns more but may overfit. Lower: Slower to learn, more generalizable. lora_dropout (Default: 0) - Dropout probability for regularization. Higher: More regularization, slower training. Lower (0): Faster training, minimal impact on overfitting. target_modules - Modules to fine-tune (default includes \"q_proj\", \"k_proj\", \"v_proj\", \"o_proj\", \"gate_proj\", \"up_proj\", \"down_proj\"). Recommended Settings: Fine-tuning all modules is recommended for best results. bias (Default: \"none\") - Controls bias term updates. Recommended Settings: Set to none for optimized, faster training. use_gradient_checkpointing - Reduces memory usage for long contexts. Recommended Settings: Use \"unsloth\" to reduce memory by an extra 30% by using our gradient checkpointing algorithm which you can read about here: https://unsloth.ai/blog/gradient. random_state - A seed for reproducible experiments. Suggested: Set to a fixed value like 3407. use_rslora - Enables Rank-Stabilized LoRA. Recommended Settings: True: Automatically adjusts lora_alpha. loftq_config - Applies quantization and advanced LoRA initialization. Recommended Settings: None: Default (no quantization). Set: Initializes LoRA using top singular vectors—improves accuracy but increases memory usage. Target Modules Explained: These components transform inputs for attention mechanisms: q_proj, k_proj, v_proj: Handle queries, keys, and values. o_proj: Integrates attention results into the model. gate_proj: Manages flow in gated layers. up_proj, down_proj: Adjust dimensionality for efficiency.
