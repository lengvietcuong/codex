These models are currently in public preview and are optimized for integrating external functions and tools.\n\nCONSOLE.GROQ.COM\n\nFor developers interested in creating custom datasets for fine-tuning, the groq-qa-generator is a CLI tool and Python library that facilitates the generation of question-answer pairs from text. It also supports exporting these pairs in JSON format and uploading them directly to Hugging Face, streamlining the fine-tuning process of large language models.\n\nGITHUB.COM\n\nIn a discussion on Hugging Face, a user inquired about fine-tuning the Llama-3-Groq-8B-Tool-Use model for Vietnamese language support. A Groq representative suggested that while the base model focuses on English, fine-tuning with Vietnamese function-calling examples could potentially enhance its performance for Vietnamese prompts.\n\nHUGGINGFACE.CO\n\nIn summary, Groq provides robust support for fine-tuning AI models, offering both the necessary tools and infrastructure to customize models according to specific requirements.",
